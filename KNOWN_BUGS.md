# Known Bugs And Risks

Refreshed on 2026-07-04. This file lists unresolved behavior only.

## Open Issues

- iNavi route-flow completion remains open beyond process startup, shell
  readiness, real splash rendering, remote input delivery, and initial mapdata
  loading. The former "map presentation gate" was the emulator swallowing all
  host-delivered visible messages via escaped-callout false positives (fixed
  2026-07-04, `2fcc365f`/`dbaf4791`); post-fix runs advance into
  `resmapi_800x480.bin` map-skin streaming with the splash progress bar at
  full width. The remaining frontier is the map screen actually presenting
  after skin decode plus the `COM7:`/`MFS1:`/`SMB1:` device-open sequence;
  keep validating with live runs.
- `happyway_win.exe` busy-waits inside its WM_ACTIVATE handler
  (`happyway_win.exe+0x28f8..0x2a18`) polling for cross-process state; it
  coexists with iNavi only because quantum rotation is unconditional. If
  startup ever wedges with happyway active and frozen counters, check that
  rotation still reaches iNavi.
- Watch for re-created zero-byte probe artifacts on the SD image
  (`INavi\traffictest.txt`, `INavi\routetest.txt`, `mapdata\soap.bin`,
  `mapdata\searchdb\oildata.dat`). `happyway_win.exe` embeds
  `traffictest`/`routetest` strings and boots dramatically slower when the
  marker files exist, so a returning zero-byte file means an emulator path is
  still materializing files on read-only existence probes. The 2026-07-04
  no-marker run did not re-create them through the splash and mapdata phases.
  Originals are preserved in `D:\INAVI_Emulator\_zero_byte_probe_artifacts_backup`.
- Scheduler/message semantics are not complete for every reentrant wait,
  cancellation, nested send, abort-if-hung, modal-loop, and cross-thread
  result-delivery combination.
- Shell notification behavior still needs integrated validation for taskbar
  rendering/routing, guest COM callback lifecycle, stale-handle ownership, and
  remove/update races.
- Loader parity is strongest in the Unicorn runtime path. Raw/non-Unicorn
  loader behavior needs explicit audit before all load variants can be treated
  as equivalent.
- Mounted storage remains synthetic for several lower layers beyond covered
  public AFS mount registration: physical block-driver forwarding, external
  cache/filter DLLs, real mounted-volume availability/powerdown, broader ACL
  persistence/enforcement, utility DLL execution, callable FMD callbacks,
  hardware-backed FLS discovery, and lower-FSD `FsIoControl` forwarding.
- GDI/text/IME fidelity is still incomplete for rendered IME UI callbacks,
  caret timing, broader font/style fallback, glyph metrics outside fixture
  ranges, complex clipping, palette/device-color behavior, alpha/mask variants,
  and remaining DIB/bitmap lifetime edges.
- File-change notification reset/error propagation still has deeper edge cases
  beyond the currently covered prefix drains, no-more-items, undersized
  buffers, null-buffer ordering, all-zero no-data reset, and fault-drain cases.
- Popup/menu/modal behavior still needs broader live nested-modal routing,
  unusual cascade cancellation, timeout edges, and user-driven dispatch
  validation.
- Sensor emulation remains partial beyond the basic live paths. GPS/NMEA now
  reaches `COM7:` in the current live run, drains into guest serial RX, and is
  returned by real `ReadFile` calls; `MFS1:`/`SMB1:` also open and receive
  sensor IOCTLs. Parsed-position consumption, broader `WaitCommEvent` cadence,
  and richer accelerometer/magnetometer sample semantics still need trace
  evidence.
- Fresh splash-phase samples still spend time in `UID1:` probing and
  resource/map loading before `COM7:` opens, so sensor data cannot explain the
  earliest visible splash interval. The current post-COM7 path reaches GPS and
  sensor devices plus map-era child windows, but final map presentation remains
  gated while the framebuffer still shows the iNavi splash artwork.
- Startup profiling still reaches real `happyway_win.exe` table/traffic
  preparation loops, but the scheduler no longer leaves an idle visible helper
  process ahead of a runnable visible parked UI process outside the live-pump
  branch. The remaining delay is not explained by unreadable MessageBox UI,
  remote input routing, or pre-COM7 sensor queuing.
- The stale `happyway_win` escaped visible-message callout no longer remains
  in `pending-wndproc`; keep watching for fresh send-stack or wait-state leaks
  before treating the splash transition as purely app readiness.
- Receiver-terminated sends no longer leave active send-stack depth behind in
  live startup; the current completed `happyway_win` send result is retained for
  sender observation without blocking receiver state.
- Remote-server control input no longer remains stuck in `pendingControlMessages`
  while live-pump CPU execution stays inside import-heavy guest work,
  block-hook-visible guest work, or inline wait timeout completions; the current
  live run drains the queue and posts touch messages to the real splash window.

## Build And Validation Risks

- The normal validation profile uses `--features unicorn,trace,win32-desktop`.
  No-feature `cargo test -j 1` is now a supported smoke profile for stub/raw
  runtime paths, but it is not a substitute for the Unicorn feature gate.
- `registry.reg` loading accepts REGEDIT text through UTF-8/lossy decoding and
  decodes typed `hex(2)`/`hex(7)` values as UTF-16. Non-UTF-8 ANSI quoted
  strings from future REGEDIT4 exports may need code-page-aware decoding.
- `git diff --check` may report CRLF warnings on existing files. Treat new
  non-CRLF whitespace findings as actionable.

## Recently Closed

- The handle-like `pc=0x00001054` no-hook crash is no longer reproduced in the
  current startup path after blocked scheduler contexts were excluded from
  direct receiver-work eligibility.
- Stale blocked-wait records for the thread that just executed are cleaned up
  at host wall-clock slice stops.
- Stale parked `GetMessage` waiters no longer force short host idle-poll slices
  while active guest CPU work is runnable.
- Remote touch/key input reaches the real iNavi window stack after the
  scheduler handoff fix. Remote GPS no longer falsely counts as drained in the
  current live sample because `COM7:` has not been opened yet.
- Stale escaped visible-message WndProc callouts no longer block later visible
  input dispatch after the CPU is already parked at their resume PC.
- Receiver/window teardown clears active send stacks for terminated synchronous
  sends.
- Missing coredll exports for `GetDeviceInformationByDeviceHandle` and
  `GetDeviceInformationByFileHandle` are closed; they now return CE-style
  device information for live device handles and covered failure cases.
- Missing coredll exports for `FindFirstDevice` and `FindNextDevice` are closed;
  they now enumerate activated device handles with CE-style search state and
  no-match/stale-handle behavior.
