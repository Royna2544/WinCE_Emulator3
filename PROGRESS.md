# Progress

Refreshed on 2026-06-20. This file records confirmed current facts only.
Older investigation ledgers were purged; use commits, logs, and targeted source
references for historical reconstruction.

## Current Snapshot

- Loader/runtime mapping reaches dynamic Unicorn DLL mapping with dependency
  loading, import patching, forwarders, rollback on failed loads, trampoline
  tracking, datafile/no-resolve handling, and CE-style attach/detach lifecycle
  behavior.
- Shell/resource behavior includes PE icon extraction, shell fallback icons,
  image lists, `DrawIconEx`, `SHGetFileInfo`, version-resource extraction, and
  several CE-compatible image-list validation and lifetime paths.
- File and storage behavior includes mounted host paths, volume-boundary checks,
  file attributes, find handles, change notifications, `CeGetFileNotificationInfo`,
  FSDMGR import shims, public AFS mount registration, synthetic disk metadata,
  sparse-sector backing, and selected FMD/file-lock/security descriptor surfaces.
- GWE/message behavior includes HWND/message-queue state, menu and message-box
  foundations, cross-thread send setup, timeout completion, nested reply paths,
  and scheduler wake integration for multiple wait classes.
- GDI/text/IME behavior covers many raw CE edge cases for DIBs, bitmaps,
  palettes, draw APIs, alpha/mask paths, selected font metrics, IME state, and
  TESTIME-backed dictionary behavior.
- Remote runtime behavior exposes status, frame capture, touch/key input,
  GPS/NMEA serial injection, debug handle snapshots, and audio/control WebSocket
  plumbing.
- Process-handle behavior includes opening launched process IDs as distinct
  handles plus raw `ReadProcessMemory`/`WriteProcessMemory` byte copies with
  CE-style handle validation and transferred-byte counts.
- Toolhelp process snapshots now expose the current process and launched child
  process entries through raw `THCreateSnapshot` memory blocks.
- Toolhelp thread snapshots now expose current and launched thread entries,
  owner process IDs, priorities, and state flags through raw `THCreateSnapshot`
  memory blocks.
- Toolhelp heap snapshots now append live process heap lists and fixed heap
  allocation entries through raw `GetHeapSnapshot` memory blocks.

## Latest Confirmed State

- The former no-hook crash at handle-like `pc=0x00001054` no longer reproduces
  after blocked scheduler contexts were removed from direct receiver-work
  eligibility. Debug handle output identifies `0x1054` as an event handle.
- Host wall-clock slice stops now purge stale blocked-wait and parked
  `GetMessage` records for the thread that just executed, avoiding impossible
  active-and-blocked thread snapshots at `THREAD_EXIT_STUB_ADDR`.
- Host live-pump idle polling no longer forces short 100 ms CPU slices while an
  active guest context is runnable.
- Current live runs reach real iNavi splash/resource state, hidden map child
  windows, open `COM7:`, and remote GPS bytes drain into the serial queue.
- Remote taps are delivered to the real owned splash popup (`0x00020008`).
  The remaining visible blocker is the guest-side transition that should hide,
  destroy, or demote that popup above the map children.

## Recent Validation

- Targeted formatting and tests passed for the blocked-thread receiver-work
  slice, stale active-wait cleanup, host idle-slice guard, and related focused
  scheduler regressions.
- Release/live validation survived the prior crash window, served framebuffer
  snapshots, consumed remote touch, and drained remote GPS into `COM7:`.
- Focused raw kernel ordinal validation covers duplicated process handles,
  shared process exit state, and process memory read/write copies.
- Focused raw kernel ordinal validation covers `THCreateSnapshot` success and
  invalid requested-process failure, thread-entry serialization, and
  `GetHeapSnapshot` heap-list and entry serialization.
- Full `cargo fmt --check` may still report unrelated pre-existing formatting
  drift in older files; treat new non-formatting whitespace findings as
  actionable.

## Working Rules

- Keep future entries concise and source-visible.
- Record completed behavior here only after code and validation support it.
- Move active work to `TODO.md`; move reproducible unresolved failures to
  `KNOWN_BUGS.md`.
