# PROGRESS

## Confirmed

- Repository started with `RULES.md`, `regs.json`, and `serial_devices.json`.
- `regs.json` contains the registry snapshot used to seed the CE registry model.
- `serial_devices.json` contains enabled guest devices including `COM7:`, `COM3:`,
  `UID1:`, `PIC1:`, `BTN1:`, `LSD1:`, `MFS1:`, `SMB1:`, `CAM1:`, and `TWV1:`.
- Initial Rust crate scaffold added for a CE-ish base:
  - CE-style registry API model backed by `regs.json`
  - device namespace
  - kernel object handle table
  - GWE windows and message queue
  - timer bookkeeping
  - waveOut-style audio state
  - memory map validation
  - Unicorn MIPS adapter boundary
  - minimal PE image inspection
- Source references are recorded in `SOURCE_REFERENCES.md` for CE registry,
  GWE queue, waveOut exports, and MFC message pump behavior.
- Rust smoke tests cover bootstrapping registry/device JSON backing plus basic
  registry, device, GWE/message, timer, audio, handle, and memory-map behavior.

## Current State

- CPU execution is not yet wired to mapped PE images or import traps.
- The default bootstrap uses `regs.json` as backing storage for the fake CE
  registry API and creates base GWE, timer, audio, and memory-map state.

## False Leads

- None yet.

## Regressions

- None yet.
