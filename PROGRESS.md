# PROGRESS

## Confirmed

- Repository started with `RULES.md`, `regs.json`, and `serial_devices.json`.
- `regs.json` contains the registry snapshot used to seed the CE registry model.
- `serial_devices.json` contains enabled guest devices including `COM7:`, `COM3:`,
  `UID1:`, `PIC1:`, `BTN1:`, `LSD1:`, `MFS1:`, `SMB1:`, `CAM1:`, and `TWV1:`.
- Initial Rust crate scaffold added for a CE-ish base:
  - CE-style registry API model backed by `regs.json`
  - device namespace
  - kernel object handle table
  - GWE windows and message queue
  - timer bookkeeping
  - waveOut-style audio state
  - memory map validation
  - Unicorn MIPS adapter boundary
  - minimal PE image inspection
- Source references are recorded in `SOURCE_REFERENCES.md` for CE registry,
  GWE queue, waveOut exports, and MFC message pump behavior.
- Rust smoke tests cover bootstrapping registry/device JSON backing plus basic
  registry, device, GWE/message, timer, audio, handle, and memory-map behavior.
- Added a virtual Win32/CE API facade on `CeKernel` for:
  - `CreateFileW`-style file/device opens
  - `ReadFile`/`WriteFile`
  - `DeviceIoControl`
  - `CloseHandle`
  - `CreateEventW`/`SetEvent`/`ResetEvent`/`WaitForSingleObject`
  - `CreateMutexW`/`ReleaseMutex`
  - `CreateWindowExW`, `PostMessageW`, `SendMessageW`, `GetMessageW`, and
    single-step message pumping
  - `SetTimer`/`KillTimer`
  - `waveOutOpen`/`waveOutWrite` plus pause/restart/reset/volume helpers
- Host-backed file opens are contained under a configurable file root and reject
  parent-directory escapes.
- Added a COREDLL export table parser for the CE `core_common.def` source. It
  reads 1,698 ordinal-bearing entries in the current source tree and resolves by
  name or ordinal.
- Added a COREDLL dispatcher that routes implemented exports to the virtual
  Win32/CE framework and reports unresolved or unimplemented ordinals explicitly.
- Added a simple `cemath` subsystem for common CE CRT math exports and MIPS
  helper routines, including `sqrt`, `pow`, `fmod`, `div`, `ldiv`, `__ll_div`,
  `__ll_mul`, soft-float add/sub/mul/div, conversion, and compare helpers.
- COREDLL dispatch table now augments `core_common.def` parsing with selected
  CRT/math ordinals from `crt_ordinals.h`; current table coverage is 1,752
  export entries.

## Current State

- CPU execution is not yet wired to mapped PE images or import traps.
- The default bootstrap uses `regs.json` as backing storage for the fake CE
  registry API and creates base GWE, timer, audio, and memory-map state.
- The virtual Win32/CE framework and COREDLL dispatcher are ready for guest
  import traps to call into, but PE import traps are not wired yet.

## False Leads

- None yet.

## Regressions

- None yet.
